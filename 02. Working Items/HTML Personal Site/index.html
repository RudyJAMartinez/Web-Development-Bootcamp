    <p><strong>Pentagon Federal Credit Union</strong> | Capital Markets Analyst</p>
    <p><em></e>September 2021 - Present</p></em>
    <ul>
        <li>Wrote Python script to query raw auto loan data and extract an eligible pool of loans (subset) by
            implementing securitization pooling criteria. The script incorporates the use of Python pandas and
            numpy for data handling and cleaning, and it integrates the use of SQL to perform the query on the
            cleaned data set.</li>
        <li>Developed Python script to read in eligible loans for securitization and automatically build
            stratification tables by Geography, Original Term to Maturity, Remaining Term to Maturity,
            FICO Score, APR, and Current Balance. The script incorporates the use of pandas and numpy for data
            handling and cleaning, and it performs automatic calculations to determine the stratification table
            ranges.</li>
        <li>Created Python script (File Forager) to navigate to a Share Drive and export a full list of all file
            names and paths in the specified directory. The script then searches for loan number matches in the
            aggregated list of file paths, exports those matches to a csv, and copies the matched files into a
            specified destination folder. Additionally, an automated checklist is produced to aid the user in
            determining the count of matches per loan across various file categories. The script incorporates the
            use of pathlib, datetime, os, pandas, and re libraries.</li>
        <li>Wrote Python script that reads in data from two sources, runs a comparison between the files, and
            identifies instances in which there is a data mismatch (discrepancies). The code then exports csv
            documents for each field name, detailing the specific rows of data where there are discrepancies.
            The script incorporates the use of pandas and numpy as well as user-developed functions to filter
            the data.</li>
